        <h2 id="1"> Refund to your Wallet Balance </h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">If your order was canceled, the funds will be credited to your Hiremyprofile Balance. Hiremyprofile doesn't automatically process refunds to your payment provider after an order's cancellation. You will see the credited funds just next to your profile picture.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="2">Refund timeline</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">Once a refund is initiated, the refund will take different amounts of time to reflect—depending on which method you choose to receive the funds.
          Example: PayPal or Credit Card. </p>

        <table class="refund-timeline-table">
          <tr>
            <th>PayPal</th>
            <td>Refunds are usually completed within 24 - 72 hours of the request being processed by Customer Support.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Credit card</th>
            <td>Refunds take slightly longer due to the card issuer's processing time. Usually, credit card refunds are completed within 7 to 10 days of the request being processed by Customer Support. However, in extreme cases, it can take up to 2 weeks.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <br>
        <h2 id="3">Incomplete refunds</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">If the funds credited to your payment provider are incomplete, remember that orders are refunded to your Hiremyprofile balance, and sometimes those funds are reused when you make any new purchases. This is why the funds credited to your payment provider may seem incomplete. Check your most recent orders to confirm if they were paid for using your Hiremyprofile balance. If you have any issues regarding your account balance, contact <a href="https://www.hiremyprofile.com//customer_support" class="text-primary">Customer Support</a>.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="4">Refunds to a different card or PayPal account</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">We are only able to refund funds to the original payment source used to process the payment. Hiremyprofile is not able to change the card or PayPal account to where the funds will be credited.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="5">Refund currency</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">If you paid for your order using a currency other than US dollars, your refund will be processed in the same currency and amount used in the payment.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">For any further questions or concerns relating to your refund, contact <a href="https://www.hiremyprofile.com//customer_support" class="text-primary">Customer Support</a>.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="6">Cancellations</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">While you should always aim to satisfy your buyers’ needs, sometimes things don’t work as planned and cancellation is the best way to resolve an ongoing order. When addressing an issue, be sure to communicate clearly and politely throughout the entire cancellation process.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 id="7">Different kinds of cancellations</h3>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">Important! Cancellations should always be considered as a last resort. Canceling orders negatively affects the buyer experience, as well as your valuable time and potential income.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Buyer-requested cancellations: If an order is marked as very late (24 hours or more), buyers can request to cancel. If you have already worked on the order, this can result in you not receiving payment. Avoid this Situation.
          </li>

          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Seller-requested cancellations: If you request to cancel, the order will be canceled if your buyer doesn't respond (after 48 hours). Always use the <a href="https://www.hiremyprofile.com/customer_support" class="text-primary">Resolution Center</a> to work things out with your buyer before contacting Customer Support.
          </li>

          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Mutual cancellations: When both parties agree to cancel a job, resolve an order using this cancellation.
            <br>Important: If your buyer doesn’t respond to you within 2 days of initiating a mutual cancellation, the job is automatically canceled. The same applies if a buyer requests the cancellation, and you remain unresponsive.
          </li>

          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Admin: If you can’t agree with your buyer, or if your buyer won’t mutually cancel, contact <a href="https://www.hiremyprofile.com//customer_support" class="text-primary">Customer Support</a> to assist.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h2 id="8">Using the Resolution Center</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">We always encourage both our sellers and buyers to try and resolve disputes within ongoing orders and to avoid cancellations. To easily resolve any disputes with your buyer, use the <a href="https://www.hiremyprofile.com/customer_support" class="text-primary">Resolution Center</a>.
        </p>



        <br>
        <h2 id="9">Cancellations & your seller level</h2>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">When evaluating a seller, all cancellations are taken into account. We are aware that some cancellations are inevitable and those cancellations have a lower impact on your performance scores.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 id="10">Order Completion Rate (OCR)</h3>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">Order completion refers to the successful conclusion of an order—where a buyer receives and approves the service that they purchased. One of the ways your performance as a seller is evaluated through the OCR:
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition"> By keeping a steady OCR, build relationships with buyers, and grow your business. It also enables you to track the quality of the service you’re providing and influence your Service’s position in the search rankings.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 id="11">Tips to decrease cancellations</h3>
        <br>
        <h4 id="12">Delivery</h4>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">Always do your best to deliver on time: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Plan your work, and make sure your delivery time is realistic </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">If on-time delivery is not possible, use the Extend Delivery option in the <a href="https://www.hiremyprofile.com/customer_support" class="text-primary">Resolution Center</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraphtermcondition">Important! Delivering an empty message or sending incomplete work, to avoid late delivery, is a violation of Hiremyprofile’s Terms of Service. This can result in your account being reviewed.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4 id="13">General guidelines </h4>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Make sure to only provide services that match your skill set—don’t offer to do anything you can’t do or are not qualified to do
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">On your Service page, accurately display your latest and original work
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Set reasonable delivery times
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Be very clear about the pricing and scope of your Service—clear enough to avoid misunderstandings.
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Communicate with your buyer and make sure you’re aligned on the service—if you are confused, contact your buyer for clarification
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">When you receive an order, make sure that you have all the necessary information to start working
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">If cancellation is inevitable, don’t wait until the last minute—give your buyer an adequate warning
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4 id="14">Prevent cancellations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Be proactive: Communicate all the necessary info on your Service description, requirements, and extras before the order to set you up for success before it’s even purchased
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Be prepared: If one of your buyers is unresponsive, initiate a mutual cancellation
          </li>
          <li class="list-unorder-term-condition">Review delivery times: If you find that you are often tempted to cancel because you’re too busy, give yourself more time to deliver
          </li>
